What is DNS (Domain Name System)?
<span class="answer">DNS stands for Domain Name System. Websites use IP addresses to locate themself on the internet so their files are reachable.</span>
</li>
<li class="internet">
    Describe how DNS works and why itâ€™s important.

What is a Domain Name?
<span class="answer">DNS stands for domain name system. It is crucial because it translates human-readable domain names (like google.com) into the numerical IP addresses that computers use to communicate on the internet. Without DNS, we would have to remember and use long strings of numbers (IP addresses) to access websites</span>
</li >
<li class="internet">
    Define a domain name and explain how it is different from an IP address.
Example: "Why do people buy domain names for websites instead of using IP addresses?"
<span class="answer">For secuirty purposes an IP addresses can change from time to time while a name is more reliable because it never changes. </span>

</li>
<li class="internet">How Does the Internet Work?
    <span class="answer">The internet works by connecting devices worldwide through a vast network of cables, routers, and servers. It uses standardized protocols like TCP/IP to ensure data is transmitted reliably and efficiently. When you access information online, your request is broken into packets, routed through the network, and reassembled at the destination. </span>
